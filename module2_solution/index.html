          <p class="bio">Alex is an odd mixture between a tomboy and a girly girl,
            she is the most athletic and fitness-minded spy of the team.
            She loves to play sports, especially soccer, video games,
            and is always trying out some new fad diet.
            Alex is also the most naive and absent-minded.
            She interprets some figures of speech literally.</p>

            <p class="bio">Sam is a smart, loyal and sweet person who,
              just like her two best friends, can become highly jealous.
              She has great leadership skills and is highly respected by
              her friends. She is always focused on the task at hand whether
              it's studying for school or fighting crime.

              <p class="bio">Clover is the most girly and flirtatious of the main group.
                She is known to have had an abundance of boyfriends and will
                do anything to get a guy. In almost all the episodes, while
                she is on a mission, she is always talking about a guy she
                wants to date or talking about an outfit she's going to wear
                on a date. </p>
